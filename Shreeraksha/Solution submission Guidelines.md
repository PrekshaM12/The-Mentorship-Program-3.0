# Solution submission Guidelines

## Folders and Files
All Leetcode solutions should be added under the name of respective topics folder. Every problem should be submitted on separate files with the problem name as the name of the file in CamelCase. Eg : C++ Solution file for problem 'Remove Duplicates from Sorted list' should be named as 'RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedList.cpp'. The format of the solution file should be as follows : 
```
/*
Author : <Your name>
Leetcode handle : @<Your Leetcode handle>
Problem name : <Problem name>
Problem link : <Link for problem statement>
Submission link : <Link for your submission code>
Difficulty level : <Easy / Medium / Hard>
*/

*** Solution Code ***

```
